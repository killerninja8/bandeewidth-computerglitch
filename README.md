# bandwidth-computerglitch

// This is my first repository, and I hope to add some really cool and somewhat readable code here. In essence, I will add code for whatever cool stuff I make at home or where I study. Feel free to add, suggest, comment, or point out any error or  improvement to my programs. Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you have a lovely day and churn out some efficient code :) !
